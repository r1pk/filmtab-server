  }
  video: {
    url: string - address to the currently playing video

    progress: number - number of seconds that elapsed from the beginning of the video (until the last update)
    updateTimestamp: number - time at which a video object was changed by, for example, a play/pause action
  }
  messages: Array {
    id: string - unique id generated by uuidv4
    author: User {
      name: string - username of the author
      color: string - user color in rgb format
    }

    timestamp: number - time at which the server received the message
  }
}
```

    }
  ```
- onLeave(client) - called if user leaves the room
  ```

    }
  ```
- `video::seek`
  ```
    message {

    }
  ```
  Server emits only one event `video::current_video_progress` to the user who joined the room
- `video::current_video_progress`
  ```
    message {
      currentProgress: number - calculated number of played seconds based on timestamp and played seconds from last action
      updateTimestamp: number - time at which the event was sent

  ```
    message {
      content: string - message with a maximum length of 140 characters.
    }
  ```

#### Client communication

communication with the client is performed through room state updates which are automatically sent to each user in the room via Colyseus.js, the only exception is the `video::current_video_progress` event which is sent by the server to the user who joined the room.
